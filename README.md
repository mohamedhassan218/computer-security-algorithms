# Security Algorithms in MATLAB

Welcome to the Computer Security Algorithms repository, where we provide MATLAB implementations of various security algorithms.

## About

This repository aims to offer robust implementations of essential computer security algorithms. These algorithms are fundamental and basics to learn about the computer security.

Each algorithm is in separated folder, inside it you'll find two files one for encryption and the other to decryption.


## Features

- Clean and concise MATLAB code for each algorithm.
- Detailed comments to aid understanding.
- Usage examples and test cases provided for each algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

- **Rail Fence**.
- 

## Usage

To utilize these algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mohamedhassan218/computer-security-algorithms.git
    ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the cloned repository.
3. Run the MATLAB scripts corresponding to the algorithm you wish to use.
